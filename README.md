## Summary:

During this meetup, we hosted two engaging sessions.

The first session focused on recent developments in Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. We explored and tested the new Misty Breez wallet by Breez Technology, and reviewed Bitcoin Optech Newsletter #348, discussing key updates and developments on the newsletter.
The second session was a hands-on workshop on Building on Bitcoin with the Bitnob API. Participants were guided through how the API works and collaborated to build a simple web application capable of sending payments to Lightning addresses.
