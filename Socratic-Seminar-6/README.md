## Summary:

This month’s BitDevs Meetup featured two engaging sessions:

First session – We welcomed new participants and revisited highlights from the previous meetup, where we set up a BTCPay Server instance. We demonstrated key features for merchants, including creating stores, linking them to different nodes and wallets, and generating payment links.

Second session – We continued with a hands-on workshop on connecting a running BTCPay Server to a web application. Participants received a sample app built with Node.js and Vue.js, which they used to connect to the server, generate invoices, and process live Bitcoin payments..

## Key Takeaways

- BTCPay Server is an open-source tool that enables anyone to integrate Bitcoin payments into their apps or projects
- Developers can contribute code to improve BTCPay Server and strengthen the ecosystem.
- It’s possible to develop plugins that connect local solutions and expand BTCPay Server’s capabilities.
