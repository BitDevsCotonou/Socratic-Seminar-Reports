## Summary:

At this meetup, we hosted two insightful sessions.
The first session centered on recent developments in Bitcoin, with an in-depth discussion of PR #32359 in Bitcoin Core. Participants debated the implications of storing data on Bitcoin and whether this proposal addresses the issue effectively. We also reviewed key highlights from Bitcoin Optech Newsletters #351 and #352, covering noteworthy updates and technical progress in the ecosystem.
The second session, led by Olaniran, was a hands-on workshop focused on understanding Bitcoin transactions. Using the Decoding Bitcoin tool by the Bitcoin Dev Project, attendees explored the transaction structure through practical exercises..
