## Summary:

At this meetup, we hosted two sessions.
The first session welcomed both new and returning participants with an open discussion around the technical foundations of Bitcoin. Attendees shared ideas and collectively discussed about Bitcoin nodes
The second session was a hands-on workshop led by Olaniran and focused on setting up a personal Bitcoin node. Participants were guided through the installation process on their own laptops, and the group explored the core functionalities of a Bitcoin node such as verifying transactions, contributing to network decentralization, and understanding the role of a full node in maintaining consensus and using Bitcoin-CLI
